phylogenetic_tree_parser
========================
This project is for my undergraduate thesis.It is an algorithm design and simulation study focusing on phylogentic tree parser. I designed a new phylogenetic tree parsing algorithm from statistical approach with a simple substitution model, JC69 (Jukes and Cantor, 1969) and compared it with a wild used phylogenetic tree parser, Neighbor-Joining (Saitou and Nei, 1987), method with a simulation study on a designed tree.
